# ResponsivenessPortfolio
Created 3 pages: index, contact, and portfolio.
Searched for bootstrap components online.
Incorporated those into a responsive layout, by adding -responsive to some of those and inserted photos and made them responsive as well by using img-fluid. Containers, columns, and rows were also in the formatting of the layout.
Wasn't sure what to put for the portfolio page so just included a few descriptions of
projects we did in class.
Linked all of the pages together by the navbar in the index.
